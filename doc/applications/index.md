MMT is an API and thus [application-independent](../philosophy/independence).
Individual applications are either part of the mmt-api project or implemented in separate projects.
In particular, these include

* a [shell](shell)
* an [IDE](jedit) based on the jEdit text editor as well as a plugin for the (IntelliJ-IDE)[intellij]
* a [build tool](../archives/building) for [MMT archives](../archives)
* a [statistics exporter](statistics) generating statistical data for [MMT archives](../archives) 
* a [graphical interface](gui)
* an [HTTP interface](server)
* a [web site](server) for browsing MMT content

The [MMT API](../api) based on MMT provides a number of knowledge management services including

* notation-based presentation,
* interactive web-browsing,
* MMT-aware databases with custom indexing and retrieval,
* project-based abstraction and work flows for building, distribution, and sharing,
* management of change,
* querying integrating hierarchic, relational, and unification-based paradigms,
* the universal OpenMath machine based on registering custom implementations with the MMT server.
